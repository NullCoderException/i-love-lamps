# I Love Lamps - Project Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the I Love Lamps flashlight collection tracker.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation üèóÔ∏è ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Create GitHub repository
- [x] Set up development environment
- [x] Create project documentation
- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind
- [x] Set up Supabase project and database schema
- [x] Implement authentication
- [x] Build core UI layout and navigation
- [x] Fix authentication redirects and cookie handling
- [x] Convert to client-side auth handling

### Phase 2: Core Functionality üî¶ IN PROGRESS

- [x] Implement flashlight CREATE and READ operations (GET, POST APIs)
- [x] Create flashlight list view with cards
- [x] Build basic emitter input (needs UI improvements)
- [ ] Implement UPDATE operations for flashlights
- [ ] Implement DELETE operations for flashlights
- [ ] Create flashlight detail/edit views
- [ ] Add search and filtering
- [ ] Implement responsive design (partial - cards are responsive)
- [ ] Implement consistent theming (dark/light mode)
- [ ] Improve emitter input UI (current UI is basic)
- [ ] Add form factors and special features management
- [ ] Migrate existing hardcoded flashlight collection
  - [ ] Create temporary endpoint for bulk import
  - [ ] Import 30+ flashlights from legacy data
  - [ ] Verify data integrity after migration
  - [ ] Remove temporary migration endpoint

### Phase 3: Data Management üìä

- [ ] Add CSV export functionality
- [ ] Create data backup and restore features
- [ ] Build collection statistics
- [ ] Add batch operations

### Phase 4: Advanced Features üöÄ

- [ ] Implement vector-based manual search
- [ ] Create AI recommendation system
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle and accessibility features
- [ ] Add image management for flashlights
- [ ] Add wishlist functionality
- [ ] Implement collection sharing

## Milestones

1. **Project Setup**: Environment, planning, and documentation ‚úÖ
2. **Authentication**: Basic auth with Supabase ‚úÖ
3. **MVP Release**: Basic flashlight tracking with authentication (Next)
4. **Enhanced Release**: Data import/export and statistics
5. **Full Release**: AI features and advanced UI

## Recent Progress

- ‚úÖ Successfully implemented authentication with Supabase
- ‚úÖ Created sign-in/sign-up pages with protected routes
- ‚úÖ Fixed cookie handling issues with Next.js 15
- ‚úÖ Implemented basic navigation with user status
- ‚úÖ Fixed authentication redirects - converted to client-side handling
- ‚úÖ Improved form visibility with proper contrast
- ‚úÖ Created database migration scripts for type synchronization
- ‚úÖ Added REYLIGHT manufacturer and synced database with TypeScript types
- ‚úÖ Implemented flashlight CREATE and READ operations (GET, POST APIs)
- ‚úÖ Created flashlight collection page with list view
- ‚úÖ Built flashlight cards with responsive design
- ‚úÖ Added flashlight creation modal with basic emitter support
- ‚úÖ Applied RLS policies for secure data access
- ‚úÖ User can successfully add flashlights to their collection

## Next Steps

1. Implement UPDATE and DELETE operations for flashlights
2. Create flashlight detail/edit page with better UI
3. Improve emitter input UI (current implementation is basic)
4. Add search and filtering functionality
5. Add form factors and special features management
6. Implement consistent dark theme across all components
7. Add validation and error handling improvements
8. Create bulk import functionality for legacy data

## Technical Achievements

- **Database Schema**: Complete with proper relationships and enums
- **TypeScript Types**: Fully typed interfaces matching database schema
- **Authentication**: Working auth flow with protected routes
- **Client-Side Navigation**: Reliable navigation with auth state management
- **API Layer**: RESTful API endpoints with proper authentication
- **UI Components**: Reusable, responsive components with Tailwind CSS
- **Data Relationships**: Working one-to-many relationships (flashlights ‚Üî emitters)
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

- **Theming**: Need consistent dark/light mode across all components
- **Server Components**: Currently using mostly client components, could optimize
- **Type Safety**: Could improve type safety in some areas
- **Error Handling**: Need better error handling and user feedback

## Development Environment

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Deployment**: Vercel (planned)
