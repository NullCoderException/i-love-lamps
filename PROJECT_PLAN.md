# I Love Lamps - Project Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the I Love Lamps flashlight collection tracker.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation üèóÔ∏è ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Create GitHub repository
- [x] Set up development environment
- [x] Create project documentation
- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind
- [x] Set up Supabase project and database schema
- [x] Implement authentication
- [x] Build core UI layout and navigation
- [x] Fix authentication redirects and cookie handling
- [x] Convert to client-side auth handling

### Phase 2: Core Functionality üî¶ IN PROGRESS

- [x] Implement flashlight CRUD operations (GET, POST APIs completed)
- [x] Create flashlight list and detail views (list view and cards completed)
- [x] Build emitter management (integrated with flashlight creation)
- [ ] Add search and filtering
- [ ] Implement responsive design (partial - cards are responsive)
- [ ] Implement consistent theming (dark/light mode)
- [ ] Add UPDATE and DELETE operations for flashlights
- [ ] Add form factors and special features management
- [ ] Migrate existing hardcoded flashlight collection
  - [ ] Create temporary endpoint for bulk import
  - [ ] Import 30+ flashlights from legacy data
  - [ ] Verify data integrity after migration
  - [ ] Remove temporary migration endpoint

### Phase 3: Data Management üìä

- [ ] Add CSV export functionality
- [ ] Create data backup and restore features
- [ ] Build collection statistics
- [ ] Add batch operations

### Phase 4: Advanced Features üöÄ

- [ ] Implement vector-based manual search
- [ ] Create AI recommendation system
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle and accessibility features
- [ ] Add image management for flashlights
- [ ] Add wishlist functionality
- [ ] Implement collection sharing

## Milestones

1. **Project Setup**: Environment, planning, and documentation ‚úÖ
2. **Authentication**: Basic auth with Supabase ‚úÖ
3. **MVP Release**: Basic flashlight tracking with authentication (Next)
4. **Enhanced Release**: Data import/export and statistics
5. **Full Release**: AI features and advanced UI

## Recent Progress

- ‚úÖ Successfully implemented authentication with Supabase
- ‚úÖ Created sign-in/sign-up pages with protected routes
- ‚úÖ Fixed cookie handling issues with Next.js 15
- ‚úÖ Implemented basic navigation with user status
- ‚úÖ Fixed authentication redirects - converted to client-side handling
- ‚úÖ Improved form visibility with proper contrast
- ‚úÖ Created database migration scripts for type synchronization
- ‚úÖ Added REYLIGHT manufacturer and synced database with TypeScript types
- ‚úÖ Implemented flashlight CRUD operations (GET, POST APIs)
- ‚úÖ Created flashlight collection page with list view
- ‚úÖ Built flashlight cards with responsive design
- ‚úÖ Added flashlight creation modal with emitter support
- ‚úÖ Applied RLS policies for secure data access
- ‚úÖ Integrated emitter management into flashlight creation

## Next Steps

1. Implement UPDATE and DELETE operations for flashlights
2. Add search and filtering functionality
3. Create flashlight detail/edit page
4. Add form factors and special features management
5. Implement consistent dark theme across all components
6. Add validation and error handling improvements
7. Create bulk import functionality for legacy data

## Technical Achievements

- **Database Schema**: Complete with proper relationships and enums
- **TypeScript Types**: Fully typed interfaces matching database schema
- **Authentication**: Working auth flow with protected routes
- **Client-Side Navigation**: Reliable navigation with auth state management
- **API Layer**: RESTful API endpoints with proper authentication
- **UI Components**: Reusable, responsive components with Tailwind CSS
- **Data Relationships**: Working one-to-many relationships (flashlights ‚Üî emitters)
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

- **Theming**: Need consistent dark/light mode across all components
- **Server Components**: Currently using mostly client components, could optimize
- **Type Safety**: Could improve type safety in some areas
- **Error Handling**: Need better error handling and user feedback

## Development Environment

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Deployment**: Vercel (planned)
