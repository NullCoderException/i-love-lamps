# I Love Lamps - Project Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the I Love Lamps flashlight collection tracker.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation üèóÔ∏è ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] Create GitHub repository
- [x] Set up development environment
- [x] Create project documentation
- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind
- [x] Set up Supabase project and database schema
- [x] Implement authentication
- [x] Build core UI layout and navigation
- [x] Fix authentication redirects and cookie handling
- [x] Convert to client-side auth handling

### Phase 2: Architecture Overhaul üîß ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] **Dynamic Database Schema**: Replaced rigid TypeScript enums with flexible lookup tables
- [x] **New Supabase Project**: Created fresh project (gpveyngmqmmwhluaaror) with clean schema
- [x] **Lookup Tables**: Dynamic manufacturers and emitter_types with proper foreign keys
- [x] **Flexible Fields**: String-based finish, battery_type, driver, UI, IP rating for flexibility
- [x] **Seed Data**: Populated 16 manufacturers and 21 emitter types from existing collection
- [x] **Schema Improvements**: Addressed GitHub Copilot feedback for better data integrity

### Phase 3: Data Migration üìä IN PROGRESS

- [ ] Create migration script to extract data from hard-coded array (78+ flashlights)
- [ ] Implement bulk import API endpoint for flashlight collection
- [ ] Import existing flashlight collection to new database
- [ ] Verify data integrity after migration
- [ ] Update TypeScript types to use dynamic lookup approach
- [ ] Update frontend components to use new dynamic data model

### Phase 4: Core Functionality Rebuild üî¶

- [ ] Implement flashlight CRUD operations with new schema
- [ ] Create flashlight list view with dynamic data
- [ ] Build improved emitter input UI using lookup tables
- [ ] Create flashlight detail/edit views
- [ ] Add search and filtering
- [ ] Implement responsive design
- [ ] Implement consistent theming (dark/light mode)
- [ ] Add form factors and special features management

### Phase 3: Data Management üìä

- [ ] Add CSV export functionality
- [ ] Create data backup and restore features
- [ ] Build collection statistics
- [ ] Add batch operations

### Phase 4: Advanced Features üöÄ

- [ ] Implement vector-based manual search
- [ ] Create AI recommendation system
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle and accessibility features
- [ ] Add image management for flashlights
- [ ] Add wishlist functionality
- [ ] Implement collection sharing

## Milestones

1. **Project Setup**: Environment, planning, and documentation ‚úÖ
2. **Authentication**: Basic auth with Supabase ‚úÖ
3. **MVP Release**: Basic flashlight tracking with authentication (Next)
4. **Enhanced Release**: Data import/export and statistics
5. **Full Release**: AI features and advanced UI

## Recent Progress - Architecture Overhaul (December 2025)

- ‚úÖ **Major Architecture Overhaul**: Replaced rigid enum-based system with dynamic lookup tables
- ‚úÖ **New Supabase Project**: Created fresh "I Love Lamps v2" project (gpveyngmqmmwhluaaror)
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Schema**: Implemented flexible manufacturers and emitter_types lookup tables
- ‚úÖ **Improved Data Model**: String-based fields for finish, battery_type, driver, UI, IP rating
- ‚úÖ **Proper Normalization**: Fixed emitter_types to use manufacturer_id FK (addressed GitHub Copilot feedback)
- ‚úÖ **Seed Data**: Populated 16 manufacturers and 21 emitter types from existing collection
- ‚úÖ **RLS Policies**: Comprehensive row-level security for all user data
- ‚úÖ **Performance Indexes**: GIN indexes for array fields, standard indexes for lookups

## Previous Progress - Original Implementation

- ‚úÖ Successfully implemented authentication with Supabase
- ‚úÖ Created sign-in/sign-up pages with protected routes
- ‚úÖ Fixed cookie handling issues with Next.js 15
- ‚úÖ Implemented flashlight CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE APIs)
- ‚úÖ Created flashlight collection page with list view and cards
- ‚úÖ Added flashlight creation modal with emitter support
- ‚úÖ Applied RLS policies for secure data access
- ‚úÖ Completed full CRUD functionality for flashlights
- ‚úÖ Implemented UPDATE and DELETE operations for flashlights
- ‚úÖ Fixed Next.js 15 compatibility with async route params
- ‚úÖ Updated enum values to proper casing (Wanted, Ordered, Owned, Sold)
- ‚úÖ Added inline edit functionality with modal reuse
- ‚úÖ Completed full CRUD functionality for flashlights

## Next Steps

1. Create flashlight detail view page with better UI
2. Improve emitter input UI (current implementation is basic)
3. Add search and filtering functionality
4. Add form factors and special features management
5. Implement consistent dark theme across all components
6. Add validation and error handling improvements
7. Create bulk import functionality for legacy data
8. Improve data model for better enum handling and field organization

## Technical Achievements

- **Database Schema**: Complete with proper relationships and enums
- **TypeScript Types**: Fully typed interfaces matching database schema
- **Authentication**: Working auth flow with protected routes
- **Client-Side Navigation**: Reliable navigation with auth state management
- **API Layer**: RESTful API endpoints with proper authentication
- **UI Components**: Reusable, responsive components with Tailwind CSS
- **Data Relationships**: Working one-to-many relationships (flashlights ‚Üî emitters)
- **Security**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

- **Theming**: Need consistent dark/light mode across all components
- **Server Components**: Currently using mostly client components, could optimize
- **Type Safety**: Could improve type safety in some areas
- **Error Handling**: Need better error handling and user feedback

## Development Environment

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Deployment**: Vercel (planned)
